This project develops a Graphic User Interface (GUI) in MATLAB to integrate multiple image processing functions such as image segmentation, skin detection, level set technique, object extraction, color separation, grayscale image combination, noise addition, and various preprocessing operations. The GUI aims to facilitate the application of these functions, making them accessible through a user-friendly interface without the need for extensive programming knowledge.
Key Features:
Image Segmentation: Divides images into segments to simplify analysis and feature extraction.
Object Extraction: Isolates specific objects within an image for detailed processing.
Noise Handling: Adds and removes different types of noise to images to simulate various environments and test filtering techniques.
Color Manipulation: Separates and combines color components of images.
Skin Detection: Identifies and analyzes skin regions in images, which can be used in medical and cosmetic applications.
How to Use:
Setup: Ensure MATLAB is installed with the Image Processing Toolbox.
Launching the GUI: Open the provided MATLAB file and run it to start the GUI.
Operation: Use the GUI buttons and controls to select and apply image processing functions to loaded images.
